<p>Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tives of the Republic of Texas, in Congress assembled, That any citizen of this Republic or resident therein, if a male, being twenty-one years old, or if a feme sole, being eighteen years old, or over, desiring to yield his or her estate for the satisfaction of creditors, and obtain exoneration from existing debts and pecuniary liabili<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties, may do so [in] observance of the following rules.</p>
<p>Rule 1. He or she may present his or her petition to the Chief Justice of the county of his or her residence, stating as nearly as recollected, the names and additions of his or her credi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tors, and sums payable to them, (which statement shall not avail as an admission of the validity or amount thereof,) and praying the benefit of this act; thereon shall be an oath, or affirmation,<pb n="503" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="39" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw> signed by the petitioner, and to be taken before the said Judge, in these words: &#8220;I, ______;, swear (or affirm) that my preceding peti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion is preferred in good faith, in order to a just transfer of my estate, to my creditors: that I have not aliened, given, lent, leased, encumbered, covered or secreted any of my estate, real, mixed or personal, or in possession, expectancy or action, with intent to de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lay, defeat or defraud my creditors; that there is not in the pos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />session of any person or persons, natural or conventional, and known to me, any of my estate on secret or collusive trust, con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dition or contingency, directly or indirectly, for my present or future benefit; and that the deed of transfer now executed to my trustees in bankruptcy, contains a full exhibition of all such of my estate, as now known to or remembered by me.&#8221; If this be false when taken, the petitioner shall be subject to prosecution and pun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ishment for perjury.</p>
<p>Rule 2. This petition shall be preceded by a notice, three weeks successively published in some gazette of the said county, or of the next nearest county having a gazette, in substance thus: &#8220;Before the Chief Justice of ______; county, on the ______; day of ______;, I will apply for discharge in bankruptcy.&#8221; The printer&#8217;s certifi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cate of the due publication, with one insertion subjoined, shall accompany the petition, and be sufficient evidence of publication.</p>
<p>Rule 3. On the day notified, or second or third day next af<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terwards, if circumstances require, the said oath or affirmation shall be administered to the petitioner by the said Chief Justice, on his solemn explanation of its terms, import and effects; and concur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rently the petitioner shall sign, seal and deliver, before the Chief Justice, a deed in this form and substance;______;&#8220;Deed of conveyance and assignment by me ______; to ______;, trustees for the use of my creditors in bankruptcy; I convey to said trustees and their successors, all my estate, real, mixed and personal, whether in possession, expectancy, action or trust, to be held, collected, applied and distributed by them in satisfaction of all my creditors, according to the rules, conditions, and limitations of the act cre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ating a system of bankruptcy; and this conveyance and assign<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment embraces whatever of such my estate as may not be recol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected and herein enumerated. The estate transferred is the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowing: [here let it be described.] Yet, out of the above, I am allowed to except, and do reserve for my support, the following: [here the reservation allowed in the fourth rule, is to be specified.] And I, with said trustees, hereunto set my name and seal, the ______; day of ______;.&#8221; A majority of the designated creditors, may nominate in writing, the three trustees to be appointed; or otherwise they shall be selected by the said Chief Justice,______;the<pb n="504" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="40" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw> deed being signed, sealed and delivered, before the said Chief Jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice, and certified by him, shall be considered as delivered for re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gistration in the said Chief Justice&#8217;s court on the day of its date; shall be recorded by the register within three months next after<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />wards, and shall be effectual from its date, as against subsequent creditors, purchasers or donees.</p>
<p>Rule 4. The reservation to the petitioner, shall be, if a mar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ried man, with wife and a child or children, or a wife only, or a child or children only to support, or if a feme sole, with or with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out a child or children, in full property, his or her homestead, with fifty acres of his or her lands, if he or she have so much, and if not, then all of his or her lands, with the improvements thereon, the fifty acres, (if so much there he,) to be selected by him or her; also one year&#8217;s provisions, one or more of the cows and calves, not exceeding three, and one or more of the horses, not exceeding two, mules or stock sufficient to work the reserved premises, one or more beds and bedding, and a sufficiency of house<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hold and kitchen furniture and farming utensils, according to the number and condition of the family; and at the allotment of the said Chief Justice, also in full property, the apparel of the family, and the professional books or tools, and implements of the art or trade of the petitioner______;always reserving the family Bible, and giv<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing to the wife or feme sole in separate property, her musical in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />struments. If the petitioner be a single man without a child to support or grand child, he shall have only one year&#8217;s occupation of his homestead, one year&#8217;s provisions, and horse, saddle and ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />coutrements, his apparel, professional books or tools, and imple<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments of his art or trade. If any of the things reserved, be not of the estate, there is to be no equivalent, except, only in respect to the year&#8217;s provisions, if not on hand, to be fixed by the Chief Justice. This reservation shall be exempt from existing debt and pecuniary liability, and from future levy, distress or attachment, unless it be charged by the act of the owner specially. If, at the reservation, there be any lien on the estate by judgment or decree, without being rendered specific by levy, it shall be discharged, and the creditor by judgment or decree, shall be remitted to priority of satisfaction out of the estate transferred in bankruptcy. If there be on any of the estate a specific lien by levy, the reservation shall be formed out of such of the estate as is not so bound.</p>
<p>Rule 5. When the oath shall have been taken, and deed de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />livered, the Chief Justice shall grant to the petitioner a discharge, thus: &#8220;Republic of Texas, ______; county, ______; before me ______;, Chief Justice of said county, this ______; day ______;, has made conveyance and assignment to ______;, trutees in bank<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="505" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="41" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>ruptcy of his (or her) estate: wherefore he (or she) is fully and forever discharged from all of his (or her) existing debts and pe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cuniary liabilities, and exonerated from any suit, arrest, proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing, levy, distress, attachment, hindrance or molestation by, or from any one, more or all of his or her present creditor or creditors. Witness my name and the seal of my court, this ______; day of ______;,&#8221; and this discharge shall have the effect it declares, in all courts, in all places, with and before all officers and persons, and to all intents and purposes. It shall be recorded by the regis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter, and on affidavit of the loss of the original, a certified copy by the register, shall be of equal force.</p>
<p>Rule 6. The said deed shall impart to the trustees, any two or one of them, power to take possession and fiduciary own<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ership of all the tangible estate of the bankrupt wheresoever situ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ated or found, to demand, receive, and acquit for any thing, or debt of such estate in the hand of any person, and to the end of obtaining possession, and the exertion of the delega<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ted fiduciary control over the same, shall have the like power, privileges and rights which the principal had prior to the trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fer; ______; If a suit be requisite, it shall be in the name, &#8220;The Trus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tees of a bankrupt.&#8221;______;In the event of a succession in the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sion, there need be no suggestion or revivor. On the death, dismission, resignation, removal or vacancy in the commission, the Chief Justice shall appoint a successor or successors by noting and signing the appointment on the margin of the record of the deed, and on the deed itself, if presented; and the certificate of the Chief Justice, or of the register, of the succession, shall be suf<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficient evidence thereof. In the like name, and without sugges<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of succession or revivor, the trustees may be impleaded and defined, if sued in respect of any of the trust estate. The trus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tees thus may sue to recover any of such estate, whether men<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned in the deed and withheld, or not enumerated therein by accident, or fraudulently, collusively or colorably, conveyed, as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sured, assigned, given, bound or bargained, or in any manner encumbered or covered, with intent to hinder, delay, defraud or defeat the creditors of the bankrupt, and all such fraudulent, col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lusive, or colorable disposition, shall be held utterly void. If in any suit prosecuted or defended by the trustees, they wish the usual appeal, it shall be granted without security. They are not to be chargeable out of their own proper estates, for any costs or moneys adjudged against them in any such suit, but payment thereof shall be adjudged to be made out of the trust fund, name<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ly: of the costs entirely, and of any pecuniary recovery on a claim against the bankrupt to be paid rateably. The trustees or any of them may be sued individually, for culpable neglect or<pb n="506" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="42" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw> mismanagement of the trust estate, or any fraudulent waste, con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />version or embezzlement thereof, if desired by a majority of the designated creditors, and such suit shall be in the name, &#8220;The creditors of ______; a bankrupt,&#8221; without using their personal names, and the recovery shall be for the rateable benefit of all the creditors, according to the principles in this act, prescribed for distribution: and shall be levied of the proper estate of the trustee or trustees sued and inculpated.</p>
<p>Rule 7. The designated creditors of the bankrupt may agree unanimously in giving written directions to the trustees concern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the management, sale, or disposition of the transferred estate, only postponing distribution until after the lapse of one year, for the exhibition of claims against the same, and as match longer as may be requisite for the admission or adjudication thereof, and a just participation of the valid claimants. In the absence of such di<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rections, the trustees on the first sale day of the sheriff of the coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ty, where the real or tangible estate is situated, after the lapse of three months for perishable estate, and of six months for slaves and lands, shall, at the court house, within the sheriffs hours of sale, make public each vendue of the trust estate, by tracts, lots, parcels or particulars, as is lawful and requisite to valid sheriff&#8217;s sales, in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cluding in the sale in the proper county, the landed reservation as subject to the occupation of the bankrupt, which is not to be inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rupted, making conveyance or assignment of the bankrupt&#8217;s title do the vendee, they presenting for signature the proper deeds. If a bid be not promptly paid, there is to be a re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sale on that or the next day; and any deficit in the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sale, shall be paid by the first vendee, otherwise he shall be immediately sued thereon: all subse<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quent sheriff&#8217;s sale days shall be regular days for sales by the trus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tees of further trust estate coming to their hands.</p>
<p>Rule 8. If, between the grant of commission, and any of such days of sale there shall be, in consequence of changes in the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dition and circumstances of the country, as shall manifestly so en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hance the value of estates as to render it probable that the trust estate will be more than sufficient to satisfy the creditors thereof, and the bankrupt, or his personal representative or heirs shall so desire, he or they may apply to the Chief Justice, granting the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mission, for a rule on the trustees to sell only a sufficient portion of the trust estate, who, on five days&#8217; citation to the trustees, or any two of them, may make such order thereon as may seem just and equitable. If, upon a partial sale ox sales, the debts of the bankrupt and the expenses of the commission shall be satisfied, the residue of the trust estate shall revert in the bankrupt or his proper legal representative, and shall be restored.</p>
<pb n="507" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="43" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>
<p>Rule 9. On the grant of their commission, the trustees shall publish, three weeks successively, in a gazette of their county, or the next nearest county having a gazette, a notice thus: &#8220;The Chief Justice of ______; county, Texas, on the ______; day of ______;, committed to us the estate of ______; a bankrupt: therefore, after three, and six months, at the sale days of the sher<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />iff, our sales will be had. If claims against the trust estate be not presented to us within one year next after the above date, they will be barred. The printer&#8217;s certificate, as in the second rule, shall be full evidence.</p>
<p>Rule 10. The trustees may recognize as valid and payable, any claim under the signature or written recognition of the bankrupt, or whose justness is known to them, provided, the creditor allow any just discount, set off, payment or equity against it, if any, and in adjusting a debt due to the trust fund, they may allow any such discount, set off, payment or equity, or in either case, if not fully satisfied with such mode of liquidation, they may resort to or re<pc force="weak">-</pc>quire suit, and therein the principle of compensation and defalca<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion shall be applied. No signature or admission of debt or liabil<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ity, made by the bankrupt subsequent to the commission, shall be received in either mode. The trustees shall make a list of the designated and other disclosed creditors; and when the balances or amounts payable to them shall be ascertained by adjustment or adjudication, shall enter them on the list. At the end of one year next after the commission, after paying the costs and expenses of the commission and reserving five per centum on the amount col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected for their compensation, they shall distribute the residue on hand, among the ascertained ratio creditors, ratably, according to the respective balances or amounts ascertained to be due, reserving like proportions to meet the claims still in litigation, paying to each its share, on being established, and retaining the shares of rejected claims for further distribution among those established. Thus they shall proceed at the end of the succeeding year, when all claims shall have been adjusted, and the debts collected, and tangible estate reduced to money, full and final distribution as aforesaid, shall be made. The only preference claims, are, the costs and necessary expenses of the commission, the compensa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of the trustees, then the pecuniary recoveries had against the bankrupt prior to the commission, and not rendered specific by levy, as aforesaid; then any debt or debts due to the republic by judgment or decree, or for taxes; but this priority of the govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment shall be only such as now exists according to the laws in force, and in the relative application thereof; the dates of the admissions of the claims of the general creditors by the trustees,<pb n="508" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="44" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw> and the adjudication of the others of such claims shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />garded equally as the dates, of adjudication or priority in regard to such claim of the government among the general creditors; except as excepted, there is to be no preference, but they are to be satisfied out of the residuum, ratably, in proportion to the ascertained amounts due to them. If there be a surplus after paying all, it shall be refunded to the bankrupt.</p>
<p>Rule 11. The trustees, from time to time, may be ruled by the Chief Justice granting the commission, by citation or attachment, out of, and returnable into his county court, on five days&#8217; service thereof, to render such account as may be deemed requisite, touch<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the commission; and at the close thereof, a general exposition to be recorded, and so on such process and service he shall have full power to adjust controversies, as between the trustees, to sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pend or remove any one or more of them, appointing successors, or requiring security, if it shall seem proper; and in all things to exert such judicial supervision over the commission as shall be needful to keep its operation within the intent and scope of this act.</p>
<p>Rule 12. The action of the said Chief Justice, in his court, or in vacation, touching the commission, shall be entered on the min<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />utes, or other memorials of the probate branch of his court, the deed excepted, which is to be registered as aforesaid: the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sion shall have its number, file, and index, in the series, and ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cording to the time of occurrence, among the estates of decedents and wards; and the office fees and charges on the commission shall be those for analogous services, proceedings and items, in the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bate department and registry of deeds.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, That no suit, proceeding, judgment or decree, shall be brought, prosecuted, or sustained in any court or judicial magistracy of this republic, on any judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment or decree of any court or tribunal of any foreign nation, state or territory; this republic, not being bound by any international law or county to give credence or validity to the adju<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dication of foreign tribunals, whose measures of justice and rules of decision are variant and unknown here; but this provision is in no degree to affect the validity or obligation of contracts, en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gagements, or pecuniary liabilities originating abroad, or the original evidence, testimony, or proof to establish the same; neither shall this provision extend to or embrace any foreign judgment or decree for specific property or recovery, introduced as the basis of a public sale, for the transmission of title, or the record, or memorial of any link or muniment of title to specific estate; all of which shall depend upon the present laws and usages of the republic; and this provision shall not in any man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="509" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="45" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>ner relate to or affect the determinations of courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction abroad, proceeding in rem, and according to the laws of nations.</p>

<p>Sec. 14. Be it further enacted, That the person who has or shall have right of entry into any real estate, consisting of lands, tenements or hereditaments, shall make entry therein within ten years next after this right shall have accrued, and on failure shall be forever barred thereafter. Yet if the person entitled shall have been, or shall be under the age of twenty-one years, a feme covert, or insane, or if forcible occupation of the premises, or county con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taining them by a public enemy, prevent entry, the time of such disability shall not be computed as a part of the period of limita<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion. The death of one, dying possessed of such estate without right, shall not be such descent to the heir of the decedent as to bar entry of the person entitled at the time of the descent, unless such decedent shall have had five years&#8217; peaceable possession. Peaceable possession within the scope of this act, is such as is con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinuous and not interrupted by adverse suit to recover the estate.</p>

By the term title, as used in this section, is meant a regular chain of transfer from or under the sovereignty of the soil: and color of title is constituted by a consecutive chain of such transfer down to him, her or them in possession, without being regular, as if one or more of the mem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />orials or muniments be not registered, or not duly registered, or be only in writing, or such like defect as may not extend to, or include the want of intrinsic fairness and honesty, or when the party in possession shall hold the same by a certificate of headright, land warrant or land scrip, with a chain of transfer down to him, her or them in possession; and provided, this section shall not bar the right of the government.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. Be it further enacted, That he, she or they, who shall have had five years like peaceable possession of real estate, culti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vating, using or enjoying the same and paying tax thereon, if any, and claiming under a deed, or deeds, duly registered, shall be held to have full title, precluding all claims, but shall not bar the government, and saving to the person or persons having superior right and cause of action, the duration of disability to sue arising from non<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age, coverture or insanity.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. Be it further enacted, That ten years of such peaceable possession and cultivation, use or enjoyment thereof, without any evidence of title, shall give to such naked possessor<pb n="632" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="168" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw> full property, precursive of all other claims, in and to six hundred and forty acres of land, including his, her or their improvement,&#8212; yet the right of the government is not to be barred, and there is saved to the person or persons having the title and cause of ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion the duration of disability to sue for non<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age, coverture or insanity.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. Be it further enacted, That the obligors or any one or more of them, whose name or names appear to any statutory bond, concerning which it is, or shall be by law provided, that it is to be, or shall become a judgment, or have the effect thereof, shall have one year next after the actual or ostensible forfeiture of the same, to move the proper court to quash said bond, or otherwise to move for, and have any issue or issues, and a jury to try the same, or any other matter of fact, which on a regular action on such bond might properly defeat or modify a recovery thereon against such obligor or obligors.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. Be it further enacted, That hereafter any party to a judgment or decree of any district court, except judgments on appeals from justices of the peace, which are to be final, believing himself, herself or themselves aggrieved, or the legal representa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tive of such party, may have an appeal to the supreme court, with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />in six months next after the adjournment of the court in which the rendition of such judgment or decree was made, which appeal shall be granted in open court at the term of the judgment or decree without petition or citation, or at any time afterwards with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />in the year, by application to the clerk, and citation to the adverse party, or his, her or their attorney, to be served at least ten days next before the first day of the return of the appeal. The appeal shall be of right; but the final process on the judgment, or decree below, shall not be superceded, unless the appellant give bond with surety or sureties approved by the court or clerk below, to the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pellee, to be void upon condition, that if the judgment or decree be not reversed, but be wholly confirmed, the appellant shall sat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />isfy the amount adjudged as well as the condemnation of the su<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />preme court; if such citation be not issued, or if issued, be not so served, and if the appellee do not enter appearance in the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pellate court, the appellant not being in fault, the said court may award an alias citation; if the citation be served within fifteen days next prior to the first day of the succeeding term of the supreme court, the cause shall be returnable to the term next afterward, or second term.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. Be it further enacted, That any grant, deed or instrument for the conveyance of real estate, or personal, or both, or for the settlement thereof in marriage, or separate property or conveyance of the same in mortgage, on trust to uses, or on con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="633" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="169" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>ditions, as well as any and every other deed or instrument required, or permitted by law to be registered, and which shall have been heretofore registered, shall, from the passage of this act, be held to have been duly registered, with the full effects and consequences of the existing laws: provided, the same shall have been acknowl<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />edged by the grantor or grantors, maker or makers, before any chief justice of the county court, or before any notary public, or be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore the clerk of the county court in whose office such record is proposed to be made, or proved before such officer by one or more of the subscribing witnesses, and certified by such officer; any ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scurity or conflict in the existing laws, to the contrary notwith<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />standing.</p>

<p>Whereas, it appears upon an investigation by a committee of both houses of Congress, that the location of land claims made prior to the 17th day of Mach, 1836, on the twenty frontier leagues bordering on the United States of the North, are con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trary to law, and there is good reason to believe that the claims, in their origin, were for the most part absolutely fraudulent<pb n="642" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="178" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw> and void; therefore, that the claims of the people within the<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />above mentioned border leagues, may be quieted and settled,.</p>
<p>Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Repre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sentatives of the Republic of Texas, in Congress assembled, That upon the application of any citizen of this republic, to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, for a patent to lands lying and comprehended within the above mentioned twenty frontier leagues, who would have, been entitled to a patent had no claim of land been located within the said border leagues prior to the 17th day of March, 1836, the said commissioner general shall issue a patent to such applicant as if no such location had ever been made.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, That all persons claiming to hold lands within the above mentioned twenty border leagues,, by virtue of any location made prior to the seventeenth day of March, eighteen hundred and thirty-six, who may wish to try the validity of their claims, shall commence their action within twelve months from the passage of this act; and all such claims founded upon locations made prior to the 17th day of March, 1836, as aforesaid, on which suit shall not be brought within twelve months from the passage of this act, shall be forever barred.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Be it further enacted, That in all suits which may be brought by authority of the second section of this act, the plain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tiff shall file his petition in the clerk&#8217;s office of the district court of the county where the claim may be alleged to lie, at least ten days before the sitting of the court to which it is made returnable, setting forth the grounds of his claim, and citing the district at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />torney to appear and contest the same on behalf of the republic, who, together with such assistant counsel as the court or the peo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ple may retain, shall represent the republic in all such suits.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Be it further enacted, That the several courts of this republic, in executing the provisions of this act, shall exercise both equity and common law jurisdiction; and in the trial of any suit authorized by this act, shall be authorized to examine the plaintiff on oath, touching the merits of his petition; and the said courts are hereby directd and required, in the adjudication of all claims or grants purporting to have originated under the laws of Mexico, or the state of Coahuila and Texas, to require of the claimant or grantee, proof of the performance of the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditions of any of his claims or grants; and when any dispute shall arise in respect to the facts of the case, the court may cause the same to be ascertained by a jury, upon an issue to be made<pb n="643" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="179" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw> up for that purpose; provided, that no part or portion of this law be considered as in any manner extending to that portion of terri<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tory now designated under the surveys of the United States, as the 17th and part of the 16th ranges of townships of Louisiana, hereto<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore surveyed and sectionized by authority of the United States.</p>
