Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Repre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sentatives of the Republic of Texas in Congress assembled, That all persons desirous to end any dispute or controversy by arbitration, for which there is no other remedy but by action of law or suit in equity, may agree, that their submission to arbitration shall be made a rule of the District or other Courts, and may insert such agreement in the submission or in the condition of the bond, agreement or promise, which agree<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, on producing an affidavit of the due execution thereof, <pb n="1127" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="81" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>by the party producing the same, and one of the subscribing wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nesses, and filing the same in Court, shall be entered of record, and an order of Court shall thereupon be made, that the parties shall submit to, and be finally concluded by such arbitration; or such persons desirous to end any dispute or controversy as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said, may personally appear before the District or other Courts, and acknowledge that they have mutually agreed to refer all their mat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ters of difference, or any particular dispute to the arbitrament of certain persons, by them agreed on and named; on their desiring such submission to be made a rule of Court, the same may be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tered of record, and a rule of Court shall be made, that the parties shall submit to, and be finally concluded by such arbitration. In either of the above cases, when the award shall be for money only, the same being returned into and accepted by the Court, judge<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment shall be rendered thereon for the party in whose favor the award is made, to recover the sum awarded, to be paid to him, to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gether with the costs of arbitration and the costs of Court, and execution may issue thereon accordingly, no judgment shall be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tered on any such award, unless it shall appear to the Court by the affidavit of the party claiming the entry of such judgment, his agent or attorney, or the return of the sheriff or his deputy, that a copy of the award and notice to appear and show cause why judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment should not be entered on the same, has been previously served on the party to be charged with the judgment at least three days before the motion for judgment shall be made. No judgment shall be entered on motion as aforesaid, after one year from the time of making the award, unless the entry of such judgment be delayed a longer time by a contest as to the validity of such award; Provided, that in no case shall the failure of a party, previous to the institu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of any suit to give or offer an arbitration bond to defend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ant to comply with the award to be rendered by such arbitration, place the party in any worse situation than if such bond had been offered or given.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, That when the award shall be for the performance of any thing other than the payment of money, the same being returned into, and accepted by the Court as aforesaid, obedience thereto may be enforced in the said Court by attachment and imprisonment in the same man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1128" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="82" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>ner as obedience may be compelled to any other rule of the Court.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Be it further enacted, That any arbitration, umpirage or award procured by perjury, corruption or undue or unfair means, shall be judged void, and may be set aside in law or equity: in equity by proceedings on original bill, and at law, on mo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, in the Court where submission is made a rule of Court, or where any suit or proceedings shall be instituted on the arbitration, bond, submission or award, complaint must be made of such corrup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion or undue practice before final judgment upon the said bond, submission or award. Whenever the arbitrators chosen shall have the privilege of calling in an umpire in case they cannot them<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves decide, it is indispensable to the validity of the award, that the parties themselves choose the said umpire at the same time they select the original arbitrators, unless the party cast, choose to waive this privilege after the rendition of the award, any party may ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />peal from a judgment rendered on an award in the same manner as from any other judgment.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Be it further enacted, That when any action may be pending in the District or other Courts and the parties desire to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fer the same, it may be done by a rule of the Court, the report of the referees being approved by the Court, and entered of record, shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury, and the like judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment shall be entered upon it as if the same finding had been by a jury, the costs of the reference shall be taxed with the other costs of the suit.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Be it further enacted, That the several Clerks of the Dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict and county Courts and Justices of the Peace, in the several counties may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses before arbitrators and referees appointed by said Court or Justice. If any witness after being duly summoned shall fail to attend, the arbi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trators or referees may issue an attachment to compel his attend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance, and the said witness shall moreover be liable to the party for refusing to attend the same, as on trials at law. The arbitrators and referees may administer oaths and affirmations to witnesses, may punish contempts committed in their presence during the hearing of a cause, the same as a Court of record, may continue the hearing of a cause from time to time, upon good cause shown, and may admit depositions to be read in evi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1129" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="83" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>dence, the same as in trials at law; Provided that any party to an arbitration may take the deposition of a witness after having given the opposite party, his agent or attorney (if he have any) five days notice of the time and place at which such deposition will be taken; Provided, however, that an additional notice of one day shall be given for every twenty miles that such party, his agent or attorney may reside from the place at which the deposition is taken; Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, that in taking such depositions, it shall not be necessary to propound interrogatories, or observe any other formalities than those herein specified, and further provided, that the opposite party may appear at such time and place, and put such cross questions as he may think proper, said notice shall specify the house at which such deposition shall be taken and before what officer.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. Be it further enacted, That such arbitrator or referee shall, before he proceeds to the duties of his appointment, take an oath or affirmation, faithfully, fairly and justly to hear and exam<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ine the cause or matters in question, and to make a true and just re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port or award (as the case may be,) according to the best of his skill and understanding, which oath or affirmation any Judge, Just<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ice of the Peace, Clerk of the District or county Court, is author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized and required to administer.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Be it further enacted, That each arbitrator and referee shall be allowed, for every days attendance to the business of his appointment, one dollar and fifty cents, to be recovered of the party with the other costs of suit, if the award or report shall entitle the prevailing party to recover costs, witnesses shall receive the same fees for attendance at arbitrations and references as are allowed them in the District Courts, Sheriffs, Constables, Clerks and Just<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ices of the Peace shall be entitled to the same fees for services per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formed in relation to any arbitration or reference as are allowed by law for the like services in their respective Courts. It shall be the duty of the Sheriff or his deputy, or some Constable of the county, when called upon by either of the parties in arbi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tration, or either of the arbitrators or referees to attend the sessions of any arbitration, summon witnesses and perform all the other duties pertaining to their office in the same man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner as if the matters were tried in the District Courts, and <pb n="1130" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="84" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>in case it may be inconvenient for the Sheriff, deputy or Constable to discharge the duties necessary in and about any arbitration, the Sheriff is hereby authorized to appoint a special deputy or dep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />uties, who shall be invested with all the powers in regard to the particular arbitration, as the Sheriff himself is invested with.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Be it further enacted, That witnesses in attendance on arbitrations shall prove up their attendance before the arbitrators, and it shall be the duty of the arbitrators in addition to their award, to make a separate return to Court, subscribed with their names, of all the costs legally incurred in and about such arbitration.</p>
