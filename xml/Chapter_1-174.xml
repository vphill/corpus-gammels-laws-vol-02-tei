<p>Republic of Texas,</p>
<p>County of <gap/></p>
<p>To the Sheriff of <gap/>County, greeting:</p>
<p>Whereas A B (or A B attorney, agent or factor, as the case may be, of C D,) hath complained on oath to <gap/>, one of the Judges of the Circuit Court <gap/>, That E F is justly indebted to him (or the said C D,) to the amount of <gap/>and oath having been also made that the said E F absconds or secretes himself, or resides beyond the jurisdiction of the court, or is about to remove himself beyond the jurisdiction of the court, so that the ordinary process of law cannot be served against him, or is about to remove his property beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and the said <gap/> having given bond and security, according to the directions of the act in such case made and provided, and made oath that an attachment is not sued for the purpose of vexing or harrassing the defendant, E F; We therefore command you that you attach so much of the estate of the said E F, if to be found in your county, (repleviable on security,) as shall be of value sufficient to satisfy the said debt and costs according to the complaint, and such es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tate so attached in your hands to secure, or so to provide that the same may be liable to further proceedings thereupon, to be had at <gap/> so as to compel the said E F to appear and answer to the above complaint of the said <gap/> When and where you shall make known to the said Court or Justice how you have executed this writ:</p>

<p>Know all men that we, <gap/> and all of the county of <gap/>, (as the case may be) are held and firmly bound unto <gap/> in the sum of <gap/>, his certain attorney, executors, adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trators or assigns; for which payment well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and each of us, our and each of our heirs, executors and administrators jointly and severally, firmly by these presents, sealed with our seals, and dated the <gap/> day of <gap/>, in the year of our Lord <gap/> The condition of this obligation is such, that whereas the above bounden <gap/> hath, the day of the date hereof, prayed an attachment at the suit of <gap/>, against the estate of the above named <gap/>, for the sum of <gap/>, and hath obtained the same returnable to the <gap/> Court of <gap/> to be holden at <gap/> on the <gap/> day of <gap/> next, or <gap/> Now if the said <gap/> shall prosecute his suit with effect, or in case he fail therein, shall well and truly pay and satisfy unto the said <gap/> all such costs and damages as shall be recovered and awarded against the said <gap/>, his heirs, executors or administrators, in any suit or suits which may be hereafter brought, for wrongly suing out the said attachment, then the above obligation to be null and void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Provided, nevertheless, That no attachment is to be abated for want of form, if the essential matters set forth in the foregoing precedent shall be set forth in the said attachment.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Be it further enacted, That a writ of attachment may issue in all cases against the property of a debtor legally sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject to the process of attachment, although the debt or de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mand of the plaintiff be not due; which attachment shall be a lien on the property attached until such debt or demand becomes due, when judgment shall be rendered and execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="103" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="103" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>tion issued. But if the property so attached be of a clearly wasting or perishable nature, then the same shall be sold, giving a credit on the same until the debt or demand of the plaintiff becomes due, or the purchasers giving bond with security for the payment of the purchase money, which bond shall be lodged with the other papers in the cause; and if the money is not paid at the expiration of the time given, the clerk or justice shall execution against the prin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cipal or security, or either of them, and the money when collected shall be paid into the hands of the clerk or justice, to abide the final decision of the cause.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. Be it further enacted, That when any estate attached shall, on the oath of the plaintiff, his or her attorney or agent, or other creditable person, be certified to any judge or justice of the peace to be likely to waste or to be destroyed by keeping, and if the person to whom it belongs, his or her attorney, agent or factor, shall not within twenty days after the levy of the attachment re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plevy the same, then such estate shall by the order of said judge or justice, be sold at public vendue by said officer, he having first ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vertised said sale at the court house, and two other public places in his county, at least fifteen days previously, and the officer shall within five days after such sale, return the order of sale to the court or justice to which the attachment is returnable, with his proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings thereon, and also at the time of making such return shall pay over into the hands of the clerk or justice all money arising from such sale which money shall be subject to the judgment on the attachment. Any officer failing to return such order of sale as above directed, shall be liable to either the plaintiff or defendant, as officers are for failing to return writs of venditioni exponas; and any officer who after the expiration of the time allowed for paying the proceeds of the sale, shall neglect or refuse to pay the same on the demand of the clerk or justice, shall be subject to the like pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings at the instance of the clerk or justice, as officers are for failing to pay over money levied upon a fieri facias.</p>

Be it further enacted, That when any person being a non-resident of this Republic is indebted to any person also a non-resident, either by judgment, note or otherwise, and removes his or her property into, or holds property in this Re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />public which would be subject to attachment for the benefit [of] a resident of this Republic, the same shall be extended to such non-resident, as is by law secured to persons residing <pb n="104" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="104" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>within this Republic: Provided, That such non-resident shall give good and sufficient security residing in this Republic, to be ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proved of by the judge of the county court, or any judge or clerk of the circuit court, for the amount, and with the like condition as required in other cases; and that in addition to the oath now required by law, such non-resident plaintiff, his agent or attorney, before obtaining any such attachment as is authorized by this act, shall swear that the defendant against [whom] such attachment is sued out, has not sufficient property <gap/>, within the knowledge or belief of such non-resident plaintiff, his agent or attorney, wherefrom to satisfy such debt or demand: And provided also, that no judicial process shall be issued against the estate of any person residing out of this Republic, by any one, whether a resident or non-resident, unless such process is granted on the original attachment, or unless the leading process in the suit has been executed on the person of the defendant when within this Republic.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Be it further enacted, That when two or more persons not residing in this Republic are jointly indebted, either as joint obligors, partners, or otherwise, then the writ or writs of attach<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment may be issued against the separate or joint estates of such debtors, or any of them, either by their proper names or by the name and style of the partnership, or by whatever any other name or names such joint debtors shall be generally reputed, known or distinguished within this Republic, or against the heirs, executors or administrators of them or any of them, and the lands, tene<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments, goods, chattels and effects, rights and credits of such debtors or any of them, shall be liable to be seized and taken for the satis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />faction of any such debt or other demand, or may be sold to satisfy the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Be it further enacted, That attachments may be levied on the defendants goods and chattels, and the manner of executing an attachment shall be by the officer&#8217;s going to the house in which, or to the person in whose possession, the defendant&#8217;s goods and chat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tels are supposed to be, and then and there declaring in the presence of one or more creditable persons of the neighborhood, that he at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taches the said goods or other effects; from and after which declara<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion the goods, money and effects, so attached, shall remain in the custody of the officer levying on the same, unless the defendant, his or her agent or attorney, or some other person, replevy the same <pb n="105" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="105" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>by giving bond and security in double the amount of the plain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tiff&#8217;s demand, conditioned that if the defendendant be condemned in the action, he shall return the specific property attached, and in case he fail to do so, the securities will do it for him; or unless claim be made to the property levied on, and bond given to try the right of the same, as in other cases on which the same pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings may be had as in trials of the right of property taken by virtue of a fieri facias; in which cases the officer shall suffer the property to remain in the possession and at the risk of the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendant or claimant. And the said replevin bond or bonds for trial of the right of property, shall be lodged with the clerk or justice where the attachment is returnable; and should any such bond be forfeited, according to its conditions, the officer taking the same shall forthwith enter thereon the necessary endorsement of forfeiture, and the clerk or justice shall immediately issue execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion on the same against all the obligors therein: which duties of clerks and other officers shall be performed under all the penal<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties and responsibilities attached to their respective offices: Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, That for satisfactory cause shown, any of the judges may provide such execution either wholly or in part, and upon such se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curity as the judge granting the same may think proper.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Be it further enacted, That whenever any officer may be required to levy an attachment, such officer may require the plaintiff in the attachment to execute to him a bond of indemnity, in order to secure such officer if it should afterwards appear that the property levied on does not belong to the defendant.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Be it further enacted, That any person against whose estate an attachment has issued, his or her attorney, agent or fac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor, may at any time before final judgment entered, or a writ of inquiry executed, upon giving special bail in double the amount of the debt, replevy the estate so attached, and plead to [the] issue, so that the plaintiff is not thereby delayed of his trial: Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, That the defendant shall not be required to give special bail before he is admitted to appear and plead.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. Be it further enacted, That if the inhabitant of any other Government have no goods or chattels within this Re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />public, but has lands within it, the sheriff shall execute such attachment upon his lands or tenements, agreeably to the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of the act concerning executions. And in case of the <pb n="106" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="106" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>death of any debtor residing out of the limits of this Republic having lands or other property therein, the creditor resident within the Republic shall in like manner be entitled to recover by attach<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment against the executors and administrators, and execution shall issue accordingly against the property so left within the Republic.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. Be it further enacted, That the person whose goods or effects are attached, shall be called the defendant in the attach<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, and the person in whose possession they are attached shall be called the garnishee.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. Be it further enacted, That when any officer shall serve an attachment in the hands of any person supposed to be indebted to, or supposed to have any of the effects of, the defendant, he shall at the same time summon such person as a garnishee, in writing, to appear at the court or before the justice where the at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tachment is returnable, on the first day of the first term of the court, if returnable to court; or at the time of the return of the attachment, if returnable before a justice of the peace; there to answer upon oath what he or she is indebted to the defendant, or what effects of the defendant he or she has in his or her posses<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sion, and had at the time of serving the attachment, and what ef<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fects of the defendant there are in the hands of any other, and what person, to his or her knowledge or belief. And it shall be lawful upon his or her appearance and examination to enter up judgment and award execution against such garnishee, for all sums of money acknowledged to be due to the defendant from him or her, and for all effects of any kind belonging to the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendant in his or her possession or custody, for the use of the plain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tiff, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the debt and costs, and all charges incident to levying the same. And all goods and effects whatsoever in the hands of any garnishee, belonging to any defendant, shall be liable to satisfy any plaintiff&#8217;s judgment, and shall be delivered to the officer serving the attachment.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. Be it further enacted That when any garnishee shall be returned by the officer, summoned in the manner aforesaid, and shall fail to appear and discover on oath, as is by this act directed, it shall be lawful for the court, and it is re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired after calling the garnishee, to enter a conditional judgment against him, upon which a scire facias shall issue against such garnishee, returnable to the next term of the court, to shew cause why a final judgment should not be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="107" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="107" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>tered against and upon said scire facias, being duly executed and returned, if such garnishee shall fail to appear according to the mandate thereof, and discover on oath in manner aforesaid, the court shall confirm such judgment, and award execution for the plaintiff&#8217;s whole judgment and costs.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. Be it further enacted, That when the attachment is returned before a justice of the peace, the garnishee shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired to appear at the return of the attachment, and answer upon oath as in the foregoing section; and in case any garnishee so sum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moned shall fail to appear and answer as above required, the justice shall enter judgment by default against such garnishee; and if the garnishee appear and answer within ten days, said judgment shall be set aside, and such judgment entered as the justice of the case requires; but if the garnishee fail to appear within ten days after judgment by default, the justice shall issue a second summons com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />manding the garnishee to appear at a term certain, and if the gar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nishee fail to appear at said time, final judgment shall be entered against him for the amount of the plaintiff&#8217;s demand and costs of suit, upon which execution shall issue.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. Be it further enacted, That in all cases when any gar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nishee shall have in his possession any property belonging to the defendant, or be indebted to him in any specific property, he shall be at liberty at any time within twenty days after judgment en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tered against him as garnishee, to deliver the same to the officer serving the attachment or holding the execution, in discharge of himself, and the same shall be sold to satisfy the judgment against the defendant; and it shall be the duty of the proper officer to de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mand the property deposed to be due from or in the possession of any garnishee, at the usual place of residence of such garnishee, within a reasonable time after the final judgment rendered.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. Be it further enacted, That if upon the examination of any garnishee, it shall appear that there is any of the defendant&#8217;s estate in the hands of any other person who has not been sum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moned, or that any other person is indebted to the defendant, the court or justice shall, upon motion of the defendant, grant a judi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cial attachment, to be levied in the hands of such person or persons so holding property of, or indebted to the defendant, who shall ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear and answer, and be liable as other garnishees.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. Be it further enacted, That the defendant may in all cases show by competent testimony that a garnishee is indebted to him in a greater amount than he is willing to admit on oath.</p>

<p>Sec. 20. Be it further enacted, That the plaintiff wishing to controvert the garnishee&#8217;s answer, may do so by making oath that he believes the same to be incorrect, whereupon an issue shall be formed and tried as in other cases.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. Be it further enacted, That every garnishee shall be allowed out of the effects attached, reasonable satisfaction for his attendance, and where no goods are attached, the same shall be taxed against the party causing such garnishee to be summoned.</p>
