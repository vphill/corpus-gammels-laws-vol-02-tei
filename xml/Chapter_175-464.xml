<p>Whereas, from a false sense of honor, the inhumane and detestable practice of duelling has been too often resorted to as a mode of adjusting or settling differences of small magnitude between in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dividuals; and to arrest this vice, the relict of an ignorant and barbarous age, justified neither by the precepts of morality nor the dictates of reason, this law is enacted.</p>
<p>Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tives of the Republic of Texas in Congress assembled, That from and after the passage of this act, if any person or persons shall deliver, offer, or send any challenge in writing, verbally or otherwise, to fight a duel, or shall accept any such challenge to fight a duel, the person or persons so offending shall be deem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="333" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="159" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>ed guilty of a high misdemeanor; and on conviction thereof, shall be fined in the sum of one thousand dollars, and be imprisoned twelve calendar months, and be rendered forever incapable of hold<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing any office of honor, trust or profit, under the Government of this Republic, from the time of such conviction.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, That if any person or persons shall hear a challenge, or an acceptance to fight a duel, knowing the same (to) be such a challenge or acceptance, or shall consent to become a second to either party to fight a duel; or shall aid or abet, or ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vise, or encourage any person to fight a duel, whether such duel be fought or not, every such person or persons shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, shall be subject to the pains and penalties prescribed in the preceding section of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Be it further enacted, That if any person shall hereafter fight a duel, and either of the combatants be killed, or receive such wound that the person so injured shall die within three months thereafter, the survivor shall be deemed guilty of manslaughter, and shall suffer the pains and penalties affixed to this offence, be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sides those prescribed in this statute.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Be it further enacted, That if any of the persons afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said shall, for the purpose of eluding the provisions of this law, leave the Republic, and there violate any one of its provisions, the person or persons so offending shall be deemed as guilty, and sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject to the like penalties, as if these several offences had been com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted within the Republic.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Be it further enacted, That if any judge of the District Court, Chief Justice of the County Court, or Justice of the Peace, have just or probable grounds of suspicion that any person or per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons are about to engage in a duel, they, or either of them, shall, by this act, have power and be compelled to issue a warrant to any constable, sheriff, or in the absence of those officers, to any person who is not a qualified peace officer, to take the body or bodies of all whom he may suspect to be concerned, either as principals, seconds, counsellors, aiders or abettors, and have them brought before him; and if, after such examinations as the Judge or Justice may think proper, it should appear there are just grounds for believing that the duel is intended, it shall be the duty of such Judge or Justice to bind the parties suspected in a recognizance in such sum as he may deem requisite, with sufficient securities, to appear at the next term of the District Court, as well as bind them to keep the peace until the rising of the court to which they are bound to appear.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. Be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of all Judges of the District Courts to give this act specially in charge <pb n="334" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="160" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>of the Grand Juries at the commencement of each of the respect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ive sessions.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Be it further enacted, That the foreman of the Grand Jury, or any member thereof, in their retirement shall have power under the authority of the Court then sitting, to send for any per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son, or persons, who on oath, shall give the Grand Jury such in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formation as they may possess, relating to or touching the viola<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of this law; and it shall be the duty of the Grand Jury to make presentments to the Court, of all such as may be violators, who shall be tried and dealt with as the existing laws may direct.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Be it further enacted, That if any Justice, or other on<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cer bound to preserve the peace, shall have knowledge of any in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tention to fight with any deadly weapons, given or received and not use or exert his official authority to arrest the parties, and prevent the duel, such justice or other officer shall, for such neglect of duty, be indicted, and on conviction, be dismissed from office.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the District Attornies to give information to the Executive, whenever a case shall arise in their respective Districts which will render the interposition of the executive authority necessary, under this law; and said Attornies shall, at the first District Court after the pass<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age of this act, or at the time of their acceptance of office, take the following oath:&#8212;&#8220;I do solemnly swear that I will to the best of my judgment, execute the duty imposed on my by the act for sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pressing duelling,&#8217; so help me God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Be it further enacted, That if any person or persons shall, in any newspaper or hand hill, written or printed, publish or proclaim any other person or persons as a coward, or any oppro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />brious or abusive language, for not accepting a challenge, or fight<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing a duel, such person or persons so offending shall, on conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, as the Courts may order and direct.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Be it further enacted, That all fines and forfeitures which shall be incurred under this law, shall be collected by the sheriff of the particular county where such offender or offenders shall reside, and paid by him into the Treasury for use of such county.</p>
